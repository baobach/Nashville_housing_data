# This is the portfolio project showcasing my data analysis skills

> In this project, I'm trying to use SQL to clean the data from the Nashville_Housing_Data dataset.
> The purpose of this project is to create a usable dataset and clean any error.
> The dataset is downloaded from **https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx**.
> The tools I'm using are Google Bigquery for querying data from the dataset.
>> 1. There are nulls data that need to be filled
>> 2. Addresses has been cramped into one column, it's better to have separated schemas like addresse, city, state
